**1. Introduction**

**Project Title**: Automated Research and Trigger Finder (ART Finder)

**Objective**: ART Finder aims to automate the process of ad creation for e-commerce marketers by scraping data from multiple sources, including YouTube, Reddit, and app reviews. The goal is to extract valuable insights that help marketers identify pain points, triggers, and strategies that perform well, ultimately improving ad effectiveness.

**2. Problem Statement**

In the world of e-commerce, creating effective ads that resonate with the audience is crucial. However, this process can be time-consuming, especially in the research phase. Gathering insights manually from platforms like YouTube, Reddit, and competitor ads is inefficient. ART Finder automates this process, providing quick, actionable insights and helping marketers improve their ad strategies.

**3. Project Overview**

**Key Features**:

1.	**Comprehensive Research Automation**: Scrapes data from YouTube comments, Reddit threads, and competitor ads. Collects feedback from e-commerce app reviews.

2.	**Actionable Insights Generation**: Identifies high-performing hooks, CTAs, and user pain points to help marketers optimize their ads.

3.	**Reference Dashboard**: Organizes and visualizes data with sentiment analysis, word clouds, and key insights.

4.	**User-Centric Interface**: Simple inputs for brand guidelines and topic search, with easy-to-navigate dashboards for insights.

**4. Data Sources**

The following platforms have been used for scraping data:

1.	**YouTube**: Scraping YouTube comments on videos related to e-commerce.

•	**Data Extracted**: Comments, sentiment analysis (positive/negative), likes, and dislikes.

2.	**Reddit**: Scraping threads and comments from relevant subreddits to identify user pain points and experiences.

•	**Data Extracted**: Comments, thread titles, sentiment analysis.

3.	**App Reviews**: Collecting reviews from e-commerce apps such as Zepto, Blinkit, BigBasket, and others.

•	**Data Extracted**: Ratings, reviews, user feedback, common complaints, and desired features.

4.	**Competitor Ads**: Scraping ad data from competitor platforms like Facebook Ads.

•	**Data Extracted**: Ad content, hooks, CTAs, and other performance metrics.

**5. Data Extraction and Analysis**

The data extraction process involves using Python-based scrapers, APIs, and libraries to collect relevant information from each platform.

1.	**YouTube Scraping**:

•	**Objective**: Scrape YouTube comments from videos related to e-commerce.

•	**Method**: Use YouTube API to fetch video comments. The data collected includes the comment, sentiment, likes, and dislikes.

2.	**Reddit Scraping**:

•	**Objective**: Collect insights from user comments on Reddit threads.

•	**Method**: Use the PRAW library to extract relevant threads and comments based on keywords such as “e-commerce” and “shopping experience.”

3.	**App Reviews Scraping**:

•	**Objective**: Extract reviews from e-commerce apps to understand customer satisfaction.

•	**Method**: Use web scraping tools like Selenium and BeautifulSoup, or API-based scraping to collect reviews and ratings from apps such as Zepto and Blinkit.

**6. Data Storage & Management**

The data is stored in **AstraDB**, a NoSQL database designed to handle large amounts of unstructured data. Each piece of scraped data is categorized (e.g., pain points, hooks, CTAs) and stored in a structured format for easy retrieval and analysis.

**7. Insights Generation**

Once the data is scraped, it is processed to extract actionable insights. This includes:

1.	**Identifying Common Pain Points**: Extracting recurring issues mentioned by users to understand what problems e-commerce platforms need to address.

2.	**Determining High-Performing Hooks & CTAs**: Analyzing competitor ads to identify which hooks and CTAs are driving engagement.

3.	**Sentiment Analysis**: Analyzing the overall sentiment of the comments and reviews to gauge customer satisfaction.

These insights are then displayed on a **dashboard** using visual tools like word clouds, graphs, and charts for easy interpretation.

**8. User Interface & Experience**

The ART Finder tool has a user-centric interface:

1.	**Input Fields**: Users can input topics, brand guidelines, or keywords they want to analyze.

2.	**Dashboard**: A clear, intuitive dashboard that visualizes insights such as sentiment analysis, trends, and actionable recommendations.

3.	**Reports**: Automated reports showcasing key insights and suggestions for effective ad creation.

**9. Future Enhancements**

Future improvements could include:

1.	**Integration with Other Platforms**: Adding more data sources like Twitter or Instagram for broader insights.

2.	**AI-Based Recommendations**: Using machine learning to provide predictive recommendations for ad strategies.

3.	**Real-Time Data Collection**: Implementing real-time scraping and analysis to give immediate insights on trending topics.

**10. Conclusion**

The ART Finder project aims to provide e-commerce marketers with actionable insights by automating the research phase of ad creation. Through the use of scraping technologies and data management systems, ART Finder simplifies the ad creation process, allowing marketers to base their strategies on real user feedback and competitor trends.
